  <h1>Pinta? What kind of name is that?</h1>
  <p>I'm an upcoming UX/UI designer and developer currently attending at the University of Maryland! I was also named after my mom's dog.</b></p>
  <p>Officially, my job is to make sure you, the user, have an useful, useable, and enjoyable time with a product. What does that even mean? Well, the term "design" is too broad nowadays;
    referring to the "look" of a product is a bit outdated. In this digital age, human interacation is key - not by putting down your phone - but by focusing on the "feel" of the design.
    If UX is the experience that a user has while interacting with a product, then UX Design is the process by which a designer tried to determine what that exprience will be.</p>
  <p>But really? I just like being able to spend hours coding in Atom and designing in Photoshop or Illustrator. All I need is a chai latt√©, a hair clip, Spotify, and you won't hear from me for
    hours on end. It's my dream to find an employer who will pay me for doing the things I love. I also promise that I won't spill my tea over my desk.</p>
